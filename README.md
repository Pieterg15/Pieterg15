## Hi, I'm Pieter 👋

🛠️ Mechanical engineer turned data wrangler — now mining fintech data like a digital prospector. <br/>
🐍 Mostly Python & SQL, but SAS and VBA still sneak in like bad exes. <br/>
✍️ Sometimes write about my problem on Medium [https://medium.com/@pieter.gouws]
🤖 Verification, ML, end-to-end builds — problem? Consider it done. <br/>
🏨 Hotel? Trafalgo. <br/>
